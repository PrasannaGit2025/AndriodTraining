# Android

## What is Android?

Android is a mobile operating system developed primarily by Google, and it is used on a wide range of devices such as smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, TVs, automotive displays, and even some home appliances. It is built on top of the Linux kernel, which provides the foundation for managing hardware like the CPU, memory, and device drivers.

## Key Characteristics of Android

- **Type**:  
  Android is an Operating System (OS), which means it manages all the hardware and software components of a device. It acts as a bridge between the physical hardware and the applications that users interact with.

- **Based On**:  
  Android is based on the Linux kernel, which is a well-known, robust, and open-source kernel used in many server and desktop systems. On top of that, Android includes many other open-source libraries, such as:
  - `libc`: A standard C library used for system-level programming  
  - `WebKit`: A browser engine used to display web pages in apps

- **User Interface (UI)**:  
  Android’s user interface is designed primarily for touch-based interaction. Users interact with apps using gestures like tapping, swiping, pinching, and scrolling. In addition to touch, Android also supports:
  - Voice input (via Google Assistant or other tools)  
  - Gesture-based navigation  
  - Accessibility support like TalkBack, screen readers, and magnification

## Programming Languages Used in Android

Developers can build Android apps and system components using multiple programming languages:

- **Java**:  
  - Initially the main programming language for Android application development.  
  - Apps run on the Android Runtime (ART) or previously the Dalvik Virtual Machine.  
  - Many core Android APIs are written in Java.

- **Kotlin**:  
  - In 2017, Google announced Kotlin as the officially recommended language for Android development.  
  - Kotlin is more concise, safe, and modern compared to Java.  
  - Fully interoperable with Java.

- **C/C++**:  
  - Used mainly for low-level system components and performance-critical native applications.  
  - Developers use the Android NDK (Native Development Kit) to write parts of an app in C/C++.

## Device Categories That Use Android

Android powers a wide range of devices, including:

- Smartphones (e.g., Samsung, OnePlus, Pixel, Vivo, Realme)
- Tablets (e.g., Samsung Galaxy Tab, Lenovo Tab)
- Smart TVs (Android TV and Google TV platforms)
- Wearables (Watches running Wear OS)
- Automotive Displays (Android Auto and Android Automotive OS)
- Smart Devices (fridges, speakers, projectors, etc.)

Android is a powerful, flexible, and open-source mobile operating system. Its Linux-based architecture, support for multiple programming languages, and adaptability across device types have made it the most widely used OS in the world for mobile and smart devices.

### 2005 – Google Acquires Android

- Google acquired Android Inc. in August 2005 for ~$50 million  
- All four founders joined Google  
- Android was kept secret while Google developed the platform internally

### 2007 – Open Handset Alliance (OHA) Formed

- Announced November 2007  
- Members included HTC, Samsung, Sony, LG, Motorola, Qualcomm, TI, T-Mobile, Vodafone  
- Goal: Free, open-source platform for mobile innovation

### 2008 – First Android Phone Launched

- HTC Dream (T-Mobile G1) released in September 2008  
- Features:
  - Touchscreen + physical keyboard  
  - Android Market (now Google Play)  
  - Built-in Gmail, Maps, YouTube  

### Core Technologies

- **Linux Kernel**: Stability, hardware control, process management  
- **Dalvik VM**: Efficient multi-app execution (later replaced by ART)
